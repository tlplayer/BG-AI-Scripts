# BG-AI-Scripts
AI Scripts for BG 1 &amp; 2

AI script names cannot be > 8 characters otherwise the game can't find the scripts.

Keep the scripts in a seperate directory from where you compile otherwise comments will be removed

Add 1 code block at a time. Make globals at the top and do advanced conditionals there. Makes the code cleaner/easier to debug.
